## TikTok Username Format Requirements

**Critical**: Users MUST follow this exact naming format for maximum viral potential:

✅ **Correct Format Examples:**
- `amanda.goviral`
- `harper.viral`
- `growth.claudia`
- `tips.by.jenna`
- `success.michael`
- `motivation.sarah`

**Pattern**: `firstname.category` or `firstname.viral` or `category.firstname`

❌ **Incorrect Formats:**
- Random usernames without format
- Numbers-only usernames
- Special characters (except dots)
- Underscores

**Why**: This format trains TikTok's algorithm to promote content in the "go viral" niche and increases virality chances significantly.

## Account Warm-Up Process

### Why Warm-Up is Critical
- New TikTok accounts are considered "cold" and get low reach
- Algorithm needs engagement history to trust your account
- Prevents shadowbanning and account restrictions
- Increases organic reach for future posts

### Warm-Up Timeline
- **Minimum**: 3 days
- **Recommended**: 5-7 days
- **Daily Activity**: Scroll FYP, engage naturally, post 1-2 original videos

### Warm-Up Requirements

**Days 1-3:**
- Scroll FYP naturally (no searching)
- Engage with "go viral" niche content when it appears
- Like, comment, follow organically
- Post 1-2 original videos

**Days 4-5:**
- Continue engaging naturally
- Post 2-3 original videos
- Build engagement history
- Track your metrics

**Day 6+:**
- Account is warmed up
- Ready to start clipping
- Can upload content more frequently

## Clipping Guidelines

### What is Clipping?
Clipping is taking popular/trending content and repurposing it into shorter, engaging clips that can go viral.

### Clipping Best Practices

**Content Selection:**

**Posting Strategy:**

- Space out posts (don't mass post)
- Engage with comments
- Respond to audience

**Optimization:**
- Use relevant hashtags
- Write compelling captions
- Post during peak hours
- Track what works
